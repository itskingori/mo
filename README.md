M.O. [★][6]
===========

[_Modus Operandi._][6]

No matter how complex the processes or magical the output is, ultimately, _**it
can and should be reduced to a set of rules**_, for continuity sake. These are
guidelines/recommendations for getting things done in a collaborative/community
environment and programming in style.

Guidelines
----------

* [Best Practice][12] - techniques that have consistently shown results
* [Code Review][9] -  how to examine each others code
* [Convention][11] - that which is considered acceptable or _polite_ to most
* [Style][13] - easy to read and good to look at


The Top Layer
-------------

* Be consistent.
* Teach, if you can.
* Publish what you learn.
* Many heads are inevitably better than one.
* Don't violate a guideline without a good reason.
* A reason is good when you can convince a teammate.
* Don't rewrite existing code to follow the code guidelines.
* Code well. Everyone leaves. Your last duty should be to hand it off to a competent successor.
* Don't wait for crisis to change, adopt an M.O. asap and stay safe.


Language
--------

* "Avoid" means don't do it unless you have good reason.
* "Don't" means there's never a good reason.
* "Prefer" indicates there's a better option, you can evaluate it's pros and cons.
* "Use" is a positive instruction.
* "Limit" is a caution against excesses.
* Lack of "Avoid", "Don't", "Prefer", "Use" or "Limit" implies a rule.
