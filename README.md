M.O. [â˜…][6]
===========

[_Modus Operandi._][6]

No matter how magical and awesome your output is, ultimately, every process can
be reduced to a set of rules. These are guidelines for getting things done in a
collaborative/community environment and programming in style.

Guidelines
----------

* [Code Review][9] -  examination of code
* Convention - considered acceptable or _polite_ to most
* Style - good to look at and read


The Top Layer
-------------

* Be consistent.
* Teach if you can.
* Publish what you learn.
* Many heads are inevitably better than one.
* Don't violate a guideline without a good reason.
* A reason is good when you can convince a teammate.
* Don't rewrite existing code to follow the code guide.
* Code well. Your last duty is to hand it off to a competent successor.


Language
--------

* "Avoid" means don't do it unless you have good reason.
* "Don't" means there's never a good reason.
* "Prefer" indicates there's a better option, you can evaluate it's pros and cons.
* "Use" is a positive instruction.
* Lack of "Avoid", "Don't", "Prefer" or "Use" implies a rule.
